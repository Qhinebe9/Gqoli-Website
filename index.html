                        <p>I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of the Free State (UFS), where I gained a comprehensive and solid foundation in several key areas of accounting and business. The program provided in-depth knowledge in accounting principles, financial management, taxation, and business law, all of which equipped me with the technical skills needed to excel in the field of accounting.

                            Beyond the academic curriculum, I also had the opportunity to engage in various student organizations, which were instrumental in my personal and professional development. These extracurricular activities allowed me to build leadership skills, work in teams, and enhance my communication abilities. By balancing academics with active participation in student organizations, I was able to cultivate a well-rounded set of skills that extended beyond the classroom and prepared me for the dynamic demands of the professional world.
                            
                            Overall, my time at UFS not only provided me with the academic knowledge required for a successful career in accounting but also helped me grow as an individual and a leader, both of which have been invaluable in my career trajectory.
